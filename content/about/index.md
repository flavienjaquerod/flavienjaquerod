## Who Am I?  
Hey! My name is Flavien Jaquerod and I'm a student at both [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) and [ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en.html) doing a Master's degree in cybersecurity. I previously did a Bachelor's in Microengineering though so I'm still quite new to this field but absolutely love it!! 

## What I Do  
- Red teaming & pentesting  
- Reverse engineering  
- Bug bounties  
- Writing security research & walkthroughs  
- Working on writing bug-free code in the [`SystemF`](https://systemf.epfl.ch/) lab at `EPFL` while using proof assistants (specifically working on [`Alectryon`](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon)) with professor `Pit-Claudel`
- Capture the flags with teams `Polygl0ts` and `0rganizers`

## Certifications and diplomas
- Bachelor's in microengineering at EPFL
- Google cybersecurity certificate
- IBM full-stack developer
- IBM cybersecurity analyst 

I am currently working to pass my `OSCP` soon-ish as well as both of [`Hack The Box`](https://www.hackthebox.com/) certifications, `CPTS` and `CBBH`, hoping to pass all three of them in 2025!
